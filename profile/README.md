Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson

As of my last update, there hasn't been any official announcement or confirmation of a Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight scheduled for 2024. However, the idea of a fight between the two has been discussed in the media and by fans, especially since Jake Paul has been making waves in the boxing world with his high-profile matches and Tyson is a legendary former heavyweight champion.

If a fight were to happen, it would likely draw a lot of attention given the hype around both personalities. Tyson, now well into his 50s, is well past his prime, but he has still shown flashes of his old power in training videos. Jake Paul, on the other hand, has been actively building his boxing career with a mix of celebrity opponents and real fighters.
